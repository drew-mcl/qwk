# Todos
- useable on windows
- autocomplete
- multiline commands
- fully intergrate logger pkg
- attach cli input from terminal
- flag to define log level
- argument errors are not being thrown correct. Should expect args releated to numbering of $1, $2. And if $* and none are provided also through error

# Maybes
- support for complex commands
- logic for commands that fail in chain. Should it stop exec? probably. 
    maybe define away to say, dont fail the chain. 
- flag that just runs everything in the quickfile

# Larger Projects
- runners 
- leverage caching


# ERRORS
- There is an issue when you rename the command thats called in a chain. It will still call the old command name and fail the execution. This should only be relevant to the chain no the parsing operation.
